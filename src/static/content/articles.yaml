    Numerous versions of the question "what is the shortest object containing all permutations of a 
    given length?" have been asked over the past fifty years: by Karp (via Knuth) in 1972; by 
    Chung, Diaconis, and Graham in 1992; by Ashlock and Tillotson in 1993; and by Arratia in 1999. 
    The large variety of questions of this form, which have previously been considered in 
    isolation, stands in stark contrast to the dearth of answers. We survey and synthesize these 
    questions and their partial answers, introduce infinitely more related questions, and then 
    establish an improved upper bound for one of these questions.

  abstract: |
    Korpelainen, Lozin, and Razgon conjectured that a hereditary property of graphs which is 
    well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph order and defined by only finitely many minimal 
    forbidden induced subgraphs is labelled well-quasi-ordered, a notion stronger than that of 
    n-well-quasi-order introduced by Pouzet in the 1970s. We present a counterexample to this 
    conjecture. In fact, we exhibit a hereditary property of graphs which is well-quasi-ordered by 
    the induced subgraph order and defined by finitely many minimal forbidden induced subgraphs yet 
    is not 2-well-quasi-ordered. This counterexample is based on the widdershins spiral, which has 
    received some study in the area of permutation patterns.

  abstract: |
    We exhibit a bijection between recently-introduced combinatorial objects known as valid hook 
    configurations and certain weighted set partitions. When restricting our attention to set 
    partitions that are matchings, we obtain three new combinatorial interpretations of Lassalle's 
    sequence. One of these interpretations involves permutations that have exactly one preimage 
    under the (West) stack-sorting map. We prove that the sequences obtained by counting these 
    permutations according to their first entries are symmetric, and we conjecture that they are 
    log-concave. We also obtain new recurrence relations involving Lassalle's sequence and the 
    sequence that enumerates valid hook configurations. We end with several suggestions for future 
    work.

    We establish an exact formula for the length of the shortest permutation containing all layered 
    permutations of length n, proving a conjecture of Gray.

- title: On The Dimension of Downsets of Integer Partitions and Compositions
  authors:

  type: article
  abstract:
    We characterize the downsets of integer partitions (ordered by containment of Ferrers diagrams) 
    and compositions (ordered by the generalized subword order) which have finite dimension in the 
    sense of Dushnik and Miller. In the case of partitions, while the set of all partitions has 
    infinite dimension, we show that every proper downset of partitions has finite dimension. For 
    compositions we identify four minimal downsets of infinite dimension and establish that every 
    downset which does not contain one of these four has finite dimension.
